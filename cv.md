## Summary
I like the development. It is interesting to learn something new. But it is important that this can be put into practice and to do something useful, especially when the task is interesting. It's not hard for me to write code and be interested in the details. I am interested in inventing new things. I am also interested in art and beautiful things. I think that everything should be beautiful and comfortable in all areas of activity. And I think I can make something more comfortable, useful and beautiful.
